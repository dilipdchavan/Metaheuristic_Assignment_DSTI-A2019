# Metaheuristic_Assignment_DSTI-A2019

Metaheuristic is high level algorithm process in data science and mathematical optimization, which give us efficiently better solution to an optimization problem 
in absence complete information or limited computer efficiency. 
For my Metaheuristic assignment I have used Python "mlrose" package to solve Discrete optimization algorithm. Correspondingly, for continuous optimization
I have used scipy.optimize and pygmo package.All these contemporary packages are really beneficial and reduce the time while implementing complex optimization algorithms. 
Thanks to all these latest python packages. 

I have created sepeate folders for Discrete Optimization Problem and Continuous optimization Problem

## Discrete Optimization
The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the aim is to establish the shortest
tour of a collection of n “cities” (i.e. nodes), starting and ending in the same city and visiting all of the other cities
exactly once. TSPs are well suited to solving using randomized optimization algorithms.

I have used here Python "mlrose" package to solve this genetic algorithm.

## Continuous optimization

In last few years, the field of global optimization has been producing various deterministic and stochastic algorithms for optimization in the continuous domain. 
These continuous optimization algorithms offer a number of exclusive advantages robust and reliable performance, global seeking capacity and little information requirement.
